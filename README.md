# FinRAD: Financial Readability Assessment Dataset - 13,000+ Definitions of Financial Terms for Measuring Readability

This repository contains 2 samples ([sample-1](https://github.com/sohomghosh/FinRAD_Financial_Readability_Assessment_Dataset/blob/main/data_sample_500.csv), [sample-2](https://github.com/sohomghosh/FinRAD_Financial_Readability_Assessment_Dataset/blob/main/data_sample_1500.csv)) from the dataset mentioned in the paper: **FinRAD: Financial Readability Assessment Dataset - 13,000+ Definitions of Financial Terms for Measuring Readability** (accepted at The Financial Narrative Processing Workshop colocated with LREC-2022, Marseille, France).

In addition to this, [data collection & cleaning scripts](https://github.com/sohomghosh/FinRAD_Financial_Readability_Assessment_Dataset/tree/main/data_collection_cleaning_EDA_scripts), [embedding extraction & model development script](https://github.com/sohomghosh/FinRAD_Financial_Readability_Assessment_Dataset/blob/main/FinRAD_Sentence_FinBERTembedding_Extraction_Modeling_13K.ipynb), and a [starter example](https://github.com/sohomghosh/FinRAD_Financial_Readability_Assessment_Dataset/blob/main/FinRAD_starting_toy_example_on_data_sample_500.ipynb) are also present. You can dowloand the model along with the weights from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/sohomghosh/finrad_model).

The embeddings & labels of the full dataset are available in the [embeddings_and_labels](https://github.com/sohomghosh/FinRAD_Financial_Readability_Assessment_Dataset/tree/main/embeddings_and_labels) directory. Several model artifacts developed by training classiers like Logistic Regression, GBM, Random Forest on the entire dataset have been made available in the [models](https://github.com/sohomghosh/FinRAD_Financial_Readability_Assessment_Dataset/tree/main/models)  directory.
